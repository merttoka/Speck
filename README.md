| Key                                      | Interaction                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `LEFT CLICK` on *wave shape*             | Sets lower bound of grain selection      |
| `RIGHT CLICK` on *wave shape*            | Sets higher bound of grain selection (reverses sample if *min > max*) |
| `LEFT CLICK` on *envelope*               | Draws bins on envelope                   |
| `0` ... `9`                              | Trigger corresponding grain on the dropdown |
| `LEFT CLICK` on *canvas*                 | Places selected grain on the cell of canvas |
| `RIGHT CLICK` on *canvas*                | Removes item from the cell of canvas     |
| ` SPACE`                                 | Start / stop timer on canvas             |
| `i`                                      | Load an image into canvas (image path is in `void setup` function) |
| `s`                                      | Save canvas as an image file             |
| `c`                                      | Clear canvas                             |
| [`SHIFT`] + `LEFT ARROW` or `RIGHT ARROW` | Move timer left or right on canvas (`SHIFT` doubles the speed) |

- You can copy sample files to `speck/samples/` directory to populate the samples list.

- The *resolution* of canvas and *total time* of canvas can be modified with `resolution` (*canvas matrix dimension*) and `maxTime` (*milliseconds*) variables at the top of `speck.pde`
